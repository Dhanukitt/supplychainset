In todayâ€™s data-driven world, multinational enterprises face the challenge of efficiently 
managing and processing vast amounts of diverse data. Optimizing big data processing 
capabilities is crucial for extracting meaningful insights, improving decision-making, and 
maintaining a competitive edge. This report focuses on designing and implementing a 
solution that leverages cloud computing technologies for efficient storage, processing, 
and analysis of big data. 
After that use the Google Cloud Platform (GCP) for practical implementation and provide 
an example of data set extraction and analysis using the
DataCoSupplyChainDataset.csv (fromhttps://data.mendeley.com/datasets/).
